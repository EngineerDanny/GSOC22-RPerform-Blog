## Introduction
This blog aims to track my progress and showcase my posts concerning the RPerform project for the Google Summer of Code 2022 program.

The RPerform project is an open-source project under the R project for statistical computing organization.

## Project description
Testing performance is important for many R packages. 
Rperform is an R package which makes it easy to run performance tests on R packages which use testthat and git. 
The main goal of this project is to get Rperform working and easy to use with GitHub actions. 
Then fix all the issues and bugs to finally publish a stable version of RPerform on CRAN.

## Project Plan
The main goal of this project is to get the Rperform package working and easy to use with GitHub actions. 
As at now, the initial version of the Rperform package has been written. <a href="https://github.com/analyticalmonk/Rperform">(Existing version)</a><br/>  
We will address and fix the issues that were encountered in the existing project.
In addition to that, we will take note of all feature requests and bugs. 
Most importantly, we should end up publishing the package on CRAN. 
The project mentors will perform all major code reviews, give comments and verify what has been done.
