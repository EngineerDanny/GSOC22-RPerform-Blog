## Project description
Testing performance is important for many R packages. 
Rperform is an R package which makes it easy to run performance tests on R packages which use testthat and git. 
The main goal of this project is to get Rperform working and easy to use with GitHub actions. 
Then fix all the issues and bugs to finally publish a stable version of RPerform on CRAN.
